To implement an optimized S3 upload strategy using prefixes in Java, you can use the AWS SDK for Java. Below is a complete example demonstrating how to upload files to S3 with a prefix strategy.

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS SDK for Java**: Make sure you have the AWS SDK for Java included in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
       <artifactId>aws-java-sdk-s3</artifactId>
       <version>1.12.300</version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **AWS Credentials**: Ensure your AWS credentials are configured in `~/.aws/credentials` or set as environment variables.

### Java Code Example

Hereâ€™s an example Java program to upload files to S3 using multiple prefixes:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3ClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.PutObjectRequest;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class S3Uploader {
    private static final String BUCKET_NAME = "your-unique-bucket-name"; // Change to your bucket name
    private static final String[] PREFIXES = {"uploads/partA", "uploads/partB"};

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AmazonS3 s3Client = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.defaultClient();

        // Array of files to upload
        String[] filesToUpload = {"file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"};

        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4); // Adjust thread pool size as needed

        for (String filePath : filesToUpload) {
            executorService.submit(() -> uploadFile(s3Client, filePath));
        }

        executorService.shutdown();
    }

    private static void uploadFile(AmazonS3 s3Client, String filePath) {
        try {
            File file = new File(filePath);
            String selectedPrefix = PREFIXES[Math.abs(filePath.hashCode()) % PREFIXES.length]; // Distributing files
            String keyName = selectedPrefix + "/" + file.getName();

            PutObjectRequest request = new PutObjectRequest(BUCKET_NAME, keyName, file);
            s3Client.putObject(request);
            System.out.println("Uploaded: " + file.getName() + " to " + keyName);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error uploading file " + filePath + ": " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **S3 Client**: The program creates an Amazon S3 client using the default configuration.
  
2. **File Upload**: It defines an array of file paths (`filesToUpload`) to upload to S3. The upload is done in parallel using an `ExecutorService`.

3. **Prefix Strategy**: The prefix is determined using a simple hash function to evenly distribute the uploads across the specified prefixes.

4. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is included to catch exceptions during upload.

### Running the Program

1. **Compile the code**. If using an IDE, simply run the program. If using the command line, ensure you have all dependencies set up.

2. **Place your files** in the same directory as the Java program or provide the correct path to your files in the `filesToUpload` array.

3. **Run the application**. It will upload the specified files to your S3 bucket, distributed across the defined prefixes.

### Conclusion

This Java example demonstrates how to implement an optimized S3 upload strategy using prefixes. You can further enhance this by implementing multipart uploads for larger files, adjusting thread pool sizes, and improving error handling based on your specific requirements.
