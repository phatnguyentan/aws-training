Hosting a Secure Web Application
1. Networking and VPC Setup
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Create a VPC to isolate your network environment.
Subnets: Create public and private subnets within the VPC. Public subnets will host web servers, and private subnets will host databases.
Route Tables: Configure route tables to control traffic flow.
Public Route Table: Routes internet traffic through an Internet Gateway.
Private Route Table: Routes traffic through a NAT Gateway for internet access from private subnets.
2. Gateways and Route Tables
Internet Gateway (IGW): Attach an IGW to the VPC to allow internet access for resources in public subnets.
NAT Gateway: Place a NAT Gateway in a public subnet to enable instances in private subnets to access the internet without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.
Route Tables:
Public Route Table: Add a route to the IGW for internet-bound traffic.
Private Route Table: Add a route to the NAT Gateway for internet-bound traffic from private subnets2.
3. Security Groups and Network ACLs
Security Groups: Act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
Web Server Security Group: Allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet and outbound traffic to anywhere.
Database Security Group: Allow inbound traffic only from the web server security group and outbound traffic to anywhere.
Network ACLs (NACLs): Provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level.
Public Subnet NACL: Allow inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic and outbound traffic to anywhere.
Private Subnet NACL: Allow inbound traffic from the public subnet and outbound traffic to the internet via the NAT Gateway3.
4. EC2 Instances and Storage
EC2 Instances: Launch EC2 instances in the public and private subnets.
Web Servers: Deploy in public subnets to handle incoming web traffic.
Database Servers: Deploy in private subnets to store application data securely3.
Storage:
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Attach EBS volumes to EC2 instances for persistent storage.
Amazon S3: Store static assets like images, videos, and backups3.
5. IAM Permissions
IAM Roles: Assign roles to EC2 instances to grant them permissions to access other AWS services.
Web Server Role: Grant permissions to read from S3 and write logs to CloudWatch.
Database Server Role: Grant permissions to read/write to RDS and access S3 for backups3.
IAM Policies: Define policies to control access to resources.
S3 Bucket Policy: Restrict access to specific IAM roles or users.
IAM User Policies: Grant developers and administrators the necessary permissions to manage resources3.
Example Architecture Diagram
VPC: Contains public and private subnets.
Internet Gateway: Attached to the VPC for internet access.
NAT Gateway: Placed in a public subnet for outbound internet access from private subnets.
Route Tables: Configured for public and private subnets.
Security Groups: Applied to EC2 instances for traffic control.
Network ACLs: Applied to subnets for additional security.
EC2 Instances: Deployed in public (web servers) and private (database servers) subnets.
Storage: EBS for instance storage and S3 for static assets.
IAM Roles and Policies: Manage permissions for EC2 instances and users.
How It Works
User Access: Users access the web application via the internet. Traffic is routed through the Internet Gateway to the web servers in the public subnet.
Web Servers: Handle incoming requests and interact with the database servers in the private subnet.
Database Servers: Store and manage application data securely, accessible only by the web servers.
Outbound Traffic: Instances in private subnets access the internet via the NAT Gateway for updates and patches.
Security: Security groups and NACLs ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed, and IAM roles and policies manage permissions for accessing AWS resources.
This setup provides a secure, scalable, and highly available environment for hosting a web application, leveraging various AWS services to ensure optimal performance and security.
