### Scenario: VPC Peering between Two AWS Accounts

**Background:**
Company A and Company B are collaborating on a joint project that requires them to share resources securely. Both companies operate in different AWS accounts, and each has its own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

- **Company A:** 
  - VPC ID: `vpc-a-123456`
  - CIDR Block: `10.0.0.0/16`
  - Region: `us-east-1`
  - Contains an application server and a database.

- **Company B:** 
  - VPC ID: `vpc-b-654321`
  - CIDR Block: `10.1.0.0/16`
  - Region: `us-east-1`
  - Hosts a web server that needs to access Company A’s application server.

**Objective:**
Establish a VPC peering connection to allow Company B's web server to communicate with Company A's application server securely, while ensuring that both companies retain control over their respective VPCs.

### Steps to Set Up VPC Peering

1. **Initiate VPC Peering Connection:**
   - Company A creates a VPC peering connection request from `vpc-a-123456` to `vpc-b-654321` in the AWS Management Console.

2. **Accept VPC Peering Connection:**
   - Company B receives the peering connection request and accepts it.

3. **Configure Route Tables:**
   - Company A updates the route table for `vpc-a-123456` to add a route that directs traffic destined for `10.1.0.0/16` (Company B’s VPC) through the peering connection.
   - Company B updates the route table for `vpc-b-654321` to add a route directing traffic to `10.0.0.0/16` (Company A’s VPC) through the peering connection.

4. **Update Security Groups:**
   - Company A modifies the security group of the application server to allow incoming traffic from Company B’s web server (specify the IP range of Company B’s VPC).
   - Company B ensures that the security group of the web server allows outgoing traffic to the application server’s IP.

5. **Test Connectivity:**
   - Company B's web server performs a connectivity test (e.g., a simple HTTP request) to verify it can access the application server in Company A’s VPC.

### Use Case:
With the VPC peering established, Company B can now access the application hosted by Company A. This setup allows for seamless integration of services while maintaining network isolation and security. Future enhancements could include setting up VPN connections or additional monitoring services as the collaboration evolves.

### Conclusion:
VPC peering allows companies to work together effectively by sharing resources while controlling access and maintaining security. This scenario illustrates a practical application of VPC peering in a multi-account AWS environment.
