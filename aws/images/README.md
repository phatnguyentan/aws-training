There are six categories to help you establish a cloud foundation.
- Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance
- Operation
- Security
- Infrastructure
- Business Continuity
- Finance
```
## Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance
> Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) helps organizations set the foundation for meeting security and compliance requirements and define the overall policies your cloud environment should adhere to. The capabilities within this area help you define what needs to happen, defines your risk appetite, and informs alignment of internal policies.
### Tagging
> ***Tagging*** enables you to **group sets of resources** by **assigning metadata** to cloud resources for a variety of purposes. These purposes include access control (such as ABAC), cost reporting :money_with_wings:, and automation :oncoming_automobile: (such as patching for select tagged instances). Tagging can also be used to create new resource constructs for visibility or control (such as grouping together resources that make up a microservice, application, or workload). Tagging is fundamental to providing enterprise-level visibility and control. :eyes:
### Log storage
> ***Log*** storage enables you to collect and store your environment logs centrally and securely. This will enable you to evaluate, monitor, alert, and audit access and actions performed on your cloud resources and objects.

### Forensics
> ***Forensics*** involves the analysis of log data and evidentially-captured images of potentially compromised resources, to determine whether a compromise occurred (and if so, how). Outcomes of root cause analysis resulting from forensic investigations are typically used to produce and motivate the application of preventative measures.
