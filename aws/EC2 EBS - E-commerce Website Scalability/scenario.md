### Scenario: E-commerce Website Scalability

**Background:**
You are managing an e-commerce website that experiences fluctuating traffic, especially during sales events. The website is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, and you need a reliable storage solution for your application data and databases.

**Requirements:**
- High availability and durability for user data.
- Ability to scale storage as traffic increases.
- Backup and recovery solutions for data.

**Implementation:**

1. **EBS Volume Creation:**
   - Create multiple **EBS volumes** to store different types of data:
     - One volume for the application code and static assets (e.g., images, CSS).
     - One volume for the database (using Amazon RDS or self-managed).
     - Additional volumes for logs and temporary data.

2. **Volume Types:**
   - Use **General Purpose SSD (gp3)** for application and database volumes to ensure low-latency performance.
   - For logs, consider using **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)** to handle large volumes of sequential I/O.

3. **Snapshots:**
   - Schedule regular **EBS snapshots** for backup purposes. This allows you to restore volumes to a specific point in time in case of data loss or corruption.
   - Use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to automate the creation and deletion of snapshots.

4. **Scaling:**
   - During high-traffic events (like Black Friday sales), you can easily increase the size of EBS volumes if needed.
   - If additional capacity is required, you can create new EBS volumes and attach them to the EC2 instances, ensuring that your website remains responsive.

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Utilize **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the performance and health of EBS volumes. Set up alarms for metrics such as volume read/write operations and latency.

6. **Disaster Recovery:**
   - In case of failure, use the latest snapshots to quickly restore EBS volumes. This minimizes downtime and ensures business continuity.

### Conclusion
By using Amazon EBS, you can effectively manage storage for your e-commerce website, ensuring high availability, scalability, and robust data protection. This setup allows your business to handle traffic spikes while maintaining a seamless user experience.
