Sharing a VPC resource across AWS accounts can be accomplished using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). This allows you to share resources like subnets, security groups, and more between accounts securely.

### Example: Sharing a VPC Subnet Across AWS Accounts

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step example of how to share a VPC subnet from one AWS account (Account A) with another AWS account (Account B).

#### Prerequisites

1. **Two AWS Accounts**: Ensure you have two AWS accounts set up (Account A and Account B).
2. **VPC and Subnet**: You need an existing VPC and subnet in Account A that you want to share.

### Step-by-step Guide

#### Step 1: Enable Resource Sharing with AWS RAM in Account A

1. **Open the AWS Management Console** in Account A.
2. Navigate to **Resource Access Manager**.
3. Click on **Create resource share**.

#### Step 2: Create Resource Share

1. **Name**: Enter a name for your resource share (e.g., `MyVPCShare`).
2. **Resources**: 
   - Click on **Add resources**.
   - Select **Subnets**.
   - Choose the subnet you want to share from the list and click **Add**.
3. **Principals**: 
   - Click on **Add principals**.
   - Enter the AWS account ID of Account B.
4. **Enable resource share**: Ensure the option to enable the resource share is checked.
5. Click **Create resource share**.

#### Step 3: Accept the Resource Share in Account B

1. **Switch to Account B** in the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **Resource Access Manager**.
3. You should see a notification about the shared resource.
4. Click on **Shared with me** in the left navigation pane.
5. Find the resource share (e.g., `MyVPCShare`) and click on it.
6. Click on **Accept resource share**.

#### Step 4: Use the Shared Subnet in Account B

Once the resource share is accepted, you can use the shared subnet in Account B to launch instances or create resources.

1. Open the **VPC console** in Account B.
2. Click on **Subnets** to see the shared subnet listed there.
3. You can now launch EC2 instances in the shared subnet.

### Example of Launching an EC2 Instance in the Shared Subnet

1. **Open the EC2 console** in Account B.
2. Click on **Launch Instance**.
3. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
4. Choose an instance type.
5. In the **Configure instance details** step:
   - **Network**: Select the VPC that contains the shared subnet.
   - **Subnet**: Choose the shared subnet.
6. Complete the rest of the steps (storage, tags, security groups).
7. Review and launch the instance.

### Conclusion

By following the steps above, you have successfully shared a VPC subnet from Account A to Account B using AWS Resource Access Manager. This setup allows resources in different accounts to utilize the same networking infrastructure, facilitating collaboration between teams or departments while maintaining isolation between accounts.
