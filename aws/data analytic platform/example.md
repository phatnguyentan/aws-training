Data Analytics Platform
1. Networking and VPC Setup
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Create a VPC to isolate your network environment.
Subnets: Create public and private subnets within the VPC. Public subnets will host data ingestion services, and private subnets will host data processing and storage services.
Route Tables: Configure route tables to control traffic flow.
Public Route Table: Routes internet traffic through an Internet Gateway.
Private Route Table: Routes traffic through a NAT Gateway for internet access from private subnets.
2. Data Ingestion
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams: Collect and process large streams of data records in real-time.
Amazon S3: Store raw data files for batch processing and archival purposes.
3. Data Processing
AWS Lambda: Process data in real-time as it arrives in Kinesis Data Streams.
Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce): Perform large-scale data processing using Hadoop, Spark, and other big data frameworks.
AWS Glue: Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to prepare data for analysis3.
4. Data Storage
Amazon S3: Store processed data in a data lake for scalable and cost-effective storage.
Amazon Redshift: Store structured data in a data warehouse for fast querying and analysis4.
5. Data Analysis and Visualization
Amazon Athena: Query data stored in S3 using standard SQL.
Amazon QuickSight: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations to gain insights from the data5.
6. Security and Access Control
IAM Roles and Policies: Manage permissions for accessing AWS resources.
Data Ingestion Role: Grant permissions to Kinesis and S3.
Data Processing Role: Grant permissions to Lambda, EMR, and Glue.
Data Storage Role: Grant permissions to S3 and Redshift.
Data Analysis Role: Grant permissions to Athena and QuickSight6.
Security Groups: Control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances and other resources.
Network ACLs (NACLs): Provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level.
7. Monitoring and Logging
Amazon CloudWatch: Monitor the performance and health of your AWS resources.
AWS CloudTrail: Track user activity and API usage for auditing and compliance.
Example Architecture Diagram
VPC: Contains public and private subnets.
Internet Gateway (IGW): Allows internet access to resources in the public subnet.
NAT Gateway: Enables instances in the private subnet to access the internet without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.
Public Subnet: Hosts data ingestion services (Kinesis).
Private Subnet: Hosts data processing (Lambda, EMR, Glue) and storage services (S3, Redshift).
Security Groups and NACLs: Ensure secure access to resources.
IAM Roles and Policies: Manage permissions for accessing AWS resources.
Monitoring and Logging: Use CloudWatch and CloudTrail for monitoring and auditing.
How It Works
Data Ingestion: Data is ingested in real-time using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and stored in Amazon S3.
Data Processing: AWS Lambda processes data in real-time, while Amazon EMR and AWS Glue handle batch processing and ETL operations.
Data Storage: Processed data is stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift for scalable storage and fast querying.
Data Analysis: Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight are used to analyze and visualize the data.
Security and Access Control: IAM roles and policies, security groups, and NACLs ensure secure access to resources.
Monitoring and Logging: CloudWatch and CloudTrail provide monitoring and logging capabilities for the entire architecture.
This architecture provides a scalable, secure, and efficient solution for a data analytics platform, leveraging various AWS services to handle data ingestion, processing, storage, and analysis.
