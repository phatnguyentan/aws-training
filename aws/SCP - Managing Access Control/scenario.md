### Scenario: Managing Access Control with AWS Service Control Policies (SCP)

#### Objective
To utilize AWS Service Control Policies (SCP) for managing permissions across multiple AWS accounts in an AWS Organization. This scenario focuses on restricting access to certain AWS services and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

#### Components

1. **AWS Organizations**: To manage multiple AWS accounts under a single organization.
2. **Service Control Policies (SCP)**: To define permissions for accounts or organizational units (OUs).
3. **AWS IAM**: For managing user access and roles within accounts.
4. **AWS CloudTrail**: For monitoring and auditing actions taken in your AWS accounts.

#### Workflow Steps

1. **Setting Up AWS Organizations**
   - Create an AWS Organization if you haven't already. This allows for centralized management of multiple accounts.
   - Add multiple accounts to the organization, for example:
     - `Dev Account`
     - `Test Account`
     - `Prod Account`

2. **Defining Organizational Units (OUs)**
   - Organize accounts into OUs based on their purpose:
     - Create an OU for `Development`.
     - Create an OU for `Production`.

3. **Creating Service Control Policies (SCPs)**
   - Define SCPs to set permission boundaries for accounts or OUs. For example:
     - **Restricting Access to Certain Services**: Create an SCP that denies access to the `AWS S3` service for all accounts in the `Development` OU.
     - **Enforcing Compliance**: Create an SCP that only allows specific services to be used in the `Prod Account`.

   Example SCP to deny access to S3 in the Development OU:
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "Action": "s3:*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Example SCP to allow only specific services in Production:
   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "ec2:*",
                   "lambda:*",
                   "dynamodb:*"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Deny",
               "NotAction": [
                   "ec2:*",
                   "lambda:*",
                   "dynamodb:*"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. **Applying SCPs to OUs or Accounts**
   - Attach the SCPs to the appropriate OUs or individual accounts:
     - Attach the SCP restricting S3 access to the `Development` OU.
     - Attach the SCP allowing specific services to the `Prod Account`.

5. **Monitoring and Auditing**
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to log all API calls made in the accounts.
   - Set up alerts in AWS CloudWatch to monitor for any unauthorized access attempts or violations of the defined SCPs.

6. **Testing and Validation**
   - Log in to accounts within the `Development` OU and attempt to access S3. The access should be denied based on the SCP.
   - In the `Prod Account`, ensure that only the allowed services can be accessed.

7. **Reviewing and Updating SCPs**
   - Regularly review the effectiveness of the SCPs and make adjustments as necessary to accommodate new services or organizational requirements.

### Summary

This scenario demonstrates how to use AWS Service Control Policies (SCP) to manage permissions across multiple AWS accounts within an organization. By organizing accounts into OUs and applying SCPs, you can enforce compliance and restrict access to AWS services based on your organizational policies. This approach enhances security and governance across your AWS environment.
