### Scenario: Website Availability with Route 53 Failover

**Business Context**: 
You run a critical e-commerce website hosted on AWS. To ensure high availability, you want to implement a failover mechanism that automatically redirects traffic to a backup site if the primary site becomes unavailable.

#### Setup:

1. **Primary Site**:
   - **Domain**: `www.example.com`
   - **Hosted on**: An EC2 instance in the **us-east-1** region.

2. **Backup Site**:
   - **Domain**: `backup.example.com`
   - **Hosted on**: An EC2 instance in the **us-west-1** region.

3. **Route 53 Configuration**:
   - **Hosted Zone**: You have a hosted zone in Route 53 for `example.com`.
   - **Health Checks**: Create a health check for the primary site that monitors the HTTP response from `www.example.com`.

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Create Health Check**:
   - Configure a health check in Route 53 to monitor `www.example.com` on port 80 (HTTP).
   - Set the health check to fail if it receives no response or a non-2xx HTTP status code.

2. **Create DNS Records**:
   - Create a **Record Set** for `www.example.com`:
     - **Type**: A (IPv4 address)
     - **Alias**: Yes
     - **Target**: The IP address of the primary EC2 instance.
     - **Failover**: Set as **Primary** and associate it with the health check created earlier.

   - Create another **Record Set** for `www.example.com`:
     - **Type**: A (IPv4 address)
     - **Alias**: Yes
     - **Target**: The IP address of the backup EC2 instance.
     - **Failover**: Set as **Secondary**.

3. **Testing**:
   - Simulate a failure of the primary site by stopping the EC2 instance or modifying its security group to block HTTP traffic.
   - Monitor Route 53; after the health check fails (usually within a few minutes), Route 53 will redirect traffic to the backup site.

### Outcome:

- When the primary site is unavailable, Route 53 automatically fails over to the backup site, ensuring minimal disruption to users.
- Users accessing `www.example.com` will be seamlessly redirected to the backup instance, maintaining the availability of the e-commerce platform.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the health checks to ensure they are functioning correctly.
- **Testing**: Periodically test the failover mechanism to ensure that it works as expected.
- **Data Synchronization**: Ensure that the backup site is synchronized with the primary siteâ€™s data to provide a consistent user experience.
