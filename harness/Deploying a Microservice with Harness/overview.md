Deploying a Microservice with Harness, Helm, and Kubernetes
1. Prerequisites:
Harness Account: Ensure you have a Harness account and the necessary permissions.
Kubernetes Cluster: A running Kubernetes cluster.
Helm: Helm installed and configured.
Harness Delegate: A Harness Delegate installed in your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Setup:
Step 1: Create a Harness Application

Log in to your Harness account.
Navigate to Setup and click Add Application.
Name your application (e.g., MicroserviceApp).
Step 2: Add a Kubernetes Service

In your application, go to Services and click Add Service.
Select Kubernetes as the deployment type.
Provide a name for your service (e.g., MyMicroservice).
Add your Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.
Step 3: Configure Helm Chart

In the service setup, select Helm as the manifest type.
Provide the Helm chart repository URL and the chart name.
Specify the values.yaml file if needed.
Step 4: Add an Environment

Go to Environments and click Add Environment.
Name your environment (e.g., Production).
Add your Kubernetes cluster as the infrastructure definition.
Step 5: Create a Workflow

Navigate to Workflows and click Add Workflow.
Select Deployment and choose Canary or Rolling deployment strategy.
Add a Deploy Helm Chart step.
Configure the Helm chart details, including the release name and namespace.
Step 6: Create a Pipeline

Go to Pipelines and click Add Pipeline.
Add stages to your pipeline, such as Build, Deploy, and Verify.
In the Deploy stage, select the workflow you created earlier.
Step 7: Trigger the Pipeline

Set up triggers to automatically start the pipeline on code commits or other events.
Go to Triggers and click Add Trigger.
Configure the trigger to start the pipeline on a new commit to your repository.
3. Deployment:
Step 1: Run the Pipeline

Navigate to your pipeline and click Run.
Monitor the deployment process in the Harness dashboard.
Step 2: Verify Deployment

Check the status of your Kubernetes pods and services.
Ensure that the application is running as expected.
Step 3: Rollback (if needed)

If there are issues, use Harness to rollback to the previous stable version.
Navigate to the Deployments section and select the previous deployment.
Click Rollback to revert the changes.
4. Best Practices:
Version Control: Keep your Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests in version control.
Monitoring: Use monitoring tools to keep an eye on the health of your services.
Security: Ensure your Kubernetes cluster and Helm charts are secure.
This scenario outlines the steps to deploy a microservice using Harness, Helm, and Kubernetes. It covers the setup, configuration, and deployment process, ensuring a smooth and efficient deployment pipeline123.
